# To-Do List App

The To-Do List App is a simple web application built with React that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed or incomplete, delete tasks, and update task descriptions. The app also stores task data in local storage, ensuring that users can access their to-do list even after closing the browser.
